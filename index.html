        <p>
        Recognized as a global leader in interactive and digital entertainment, Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) is responsible for the PlayStationÂ® brand and family of products and services.
         PlayStation has delivered innovation to the market since the launch of the original PlayStation in Japan in 1994.
        The original PlayStation was designed as a multi-media and multi-purpose entertainment unit.
         Besides being able to play Super Nintendo games, 
         the PlayStation could play audio CDs and could read CDs with computer and video information.
